This package contains an altered version of SNE implementation for the paper "SNE: signed network embedding" writen by S.Yuan, X. Wu and Y.Xiang.

The changes which have been made to the code update the use of TensorFlow and SciKit-Learn to use later versions than in the original code.
Some code has also been added when it has been needed for this project.

.. note: bookcold is the author of the initial code. Virgile Sucal has only made some changes.
